WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net hex7/Mram__n00256 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register3_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register12_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register11_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register2_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register5_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register4_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register13_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register15_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register6_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U0/U3/Mram_Register14_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.
DRC detected 0 errors and 12 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
